# NIMS: National Incident Management System
NIMS is a platform based on the devOps philosophy to trigger alerts when incidents or natural catastrophes occur and manage relief efforts at country level. The core use case of nims is to trigger alerts when natural catastrophes like flooding or wildfires are occuring. Many countries still don't have a national alerting system, and they can learn from DevOps and Observability techniques to build an open framework, that relies on existing tools to build one.
